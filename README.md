Supplementary code for the paper "Stochastic activity in low-rank recurrent neural networks" F. Mastrogiuseppe, J. Carmona, C. Machens (2025)

Instructions:

* the 'fct_xxx.py' files contain the accessory functions that are used in the main scripts;
* the main scripts associated with different figures are contained in different folders
(LowDimInput for Fig. 2; HighDimInput for Fig. 3-4; HigherRank for Fig. 5; EI for Fig. 6);
* every folder contains the code which can be used to re-generate the sample figures which are attached (the Data folder is originally empty);
* the notation and the parameters are the same as in the main paper and Methods if not differently stated.
